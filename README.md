# Crow Meme Configuration

You can define a meme using a line like this. MAKE SURE YOU GET ALL THE PUNCTUATION RIGHT.

A random image from the defined ones will be sent to the current hangout if you use one of the keywords with any valid image file extension (doesn't have to be the right one)

So, the breakdown is:

`|keyword0,keyword1,keyword2|[1](http://your.image.link/notporn.jpg) [2](http://your.image.link/notporn1.jpg) [3](http://your.image.link/definitelynotporn.jpg)|`
